# GetingToKnowEachother
Author Grant: Gallagher
Purpose: Create a getting to know eachother website for class
Sampled Code. I sampled code from what we had to read in both the W3C website on both HTML and CSS. 
I also sampled code the the web app development book from O'Rielly Books in both CSS and HTML
Lastly I sampled code from "How to Create Image Slider Using HTML and CSS | Image Slideshow Tutorial" by Clever Techie on YouTube.
